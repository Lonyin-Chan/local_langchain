Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.'), Document(id='12b88a00-270c-4172-8f72-fff79c7c3263', metadata={'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/', 'start_index': 41420}, page_content='[6] Google Blog. “Announcing ScaNN: Efficient Vector Similarity Search” July 28, 2020.\n[7] https://chat.openai.com/share/46ff149e-a4c7-4dd7-a800-fc4a642ea389\n[8] Shinn & Labash. “Reflexion: an autonomous agent with dynamic memory and self-reflection” arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.11366 (2023).\n[9] Laskin et al. “In-context Reinforcement Learning with Algorithm Distillation” ICLR 2023.\n[10] Karpas et al. “MRKL Systems A modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language models, external knowledge sources and discrete reasoning.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.00445 (2022).\n[11] Nakano et al. “Webgpt: Browser-assisted question-answering with human feedback.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.09332 (2021).\n[12] Parisi et al. “TALM: Tool Augmented Language Models”\n[13] Schick et al. “Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.04761 (2023).\n[14] Weaviate Blog.
